# Write script with following functionality:
#
#   If -v tag is passed, replaces lowercase characters with uppercase and vise versa
#   If -s is passed, script substitutes <A_WORD> with <B_WORD> in text (case sensitive)
#   If -r is passed, script reverses text lines
#   If -l is passed, script converts all the text to lower case
#   If -u is passed, script converts all the text to upper case
#   Script should work with -i <input file> -o <output file> tags
